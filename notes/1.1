Static vs. Dynamic Methods
FSet.emptySet(s)
	all arguments are named in the paren list.  if the static argument refers to "this", there is an error.  static methods are attached to a class, not to objects.
s.toString()
	s is a receiver, which is an implicit argument.  toString() refers to s as 	"this".  
	
Question: can you do "s.emptySet()"?
s.emptySet() ----> deprecated.  do not do this.  You can do it, but it's bad practice.
-------

basic creators

	Examples:
		emptySet
		adjoin
		
derived creator
	a creator defined in terms of a basic creator.
	Examples:
		add
		without
		union
		intersect
		etc...
		
FSet is an example of an immutable abstract data type.
