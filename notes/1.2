the main method in java always looks like this:

public static void main (String[] args) {

}

why does it need to be static?
	because it's run at the beginning of the program.  No objects have been created yet.  
	Dynamic methods can only be called with/from objects.  
	Static methods belong to classes
	non-static methods belong to instances of classes
